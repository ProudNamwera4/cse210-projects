To begin using the shopping cart, you start off by providing your first name and then the last name.
You will be provided with a shopping cart menu from which you can access defferent actions of the program.
You hav 10 options from the menu, from which you can add your items, remove them or even pay fro your cart 
just to name a few.
I have designed the program in a way that guides the user to on how to use the program. For instance
you can not pay for the total price of your cart without first computing it or providing your banking details.

You can add either a basic item like milk and then it's price. Or add an item you would like in bulk,
eg. bananas , their price and quantity. bananas-4-2.
After adding all you need to your cart, you can also save it to a file or view the cart for all it's contents.
You may also view any previous transactions to keep record of the ammount used in previous payments and the 
date and time it occured.
I have also tried to handle a couple of exceptions. However to experience the best version of the program, it would be 
wise to provide a string where it is needed and not an integer or otherwise.
